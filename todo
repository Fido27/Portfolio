    - Make confetti when we press next

    - Hitbox for the save slots

    - Animate should play for the multipled vector and the scalar number should be the number of people in the hallways

    - label for levels

    - level 5 and other levels default values are not set properly when the level starts

    -  //level 5 should not change the vector when arrows are pressed
