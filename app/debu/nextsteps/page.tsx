                I've said almost everything I wanted to say. I don't just wanna be the person you go to when you're sad. I want to be the reason you're happy. I'm sorry I fucked that up when I had the chance. I was lazy, immature and not sure about what I wanted. I know my word doesnt mean shit and talk is cheap; its the doing that matters and I havent done anything to back my claims. All I can ask you rn is to trust me and give me a chance. So here are some ideas from my side. <br/>
                If you maybe wanna give me a chance, then let me take you out the next time we meet, let me make you fall in love with me again. Ill show you that I've changed for the better and I can treat you better than ANYONE. And if you disagree with me then, issok, atleast I'll be happy to know that I tried and I couldnt win you because of my own foolishness.<br/>
                If you believe in me and you trust that I can change and win you over, then make me your psudoboyfriend and see how I'm changing. Let me talk to you on text and call before we can actually meet. Lemme tell you whats going on in my life and I would love it if we check in on each other. I wanna take your opinions on things. You have insights on things I dont know exists and Ive always loved how you look at some aspects from a unique peculier angle. We can continue doing our things and talk beech beech me. You can test me during this time, remould me to love you however you want. Tell me whenever you'd want me to do something and watch me do all you want. I will happily be your bitch again. I would love to lay a better foundation for our relationship. Belive me if it was someone else, I wouldve taken the L and moved on or maybe moved on happier without taking the L. But its you. My actual true love. Ive been close to a lot of people, but the rythm that my heart plays when you're around whispers the love that blooms your memory; and I know your heart beats in sync.<br/>
                If im successful then put a permanent collar and leash and make me your bitch because Im literally programmed to love you and I don't know how to do anything else.
